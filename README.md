**Hi there, I'm Finley/Vex ([@VeraxonHD](https://github.com/veraxonhd)). I'm a computer science student in my final year at University.**

I'm 21 years old and from the UK. I identify as non-binary, and my pronouns are _They/He/She_.

My development experience includes work with Discord bots using JavaScript/NodeJS, as well as applications and projects written in C/C++/C#, Java, Python and HTML/CSS.
That being said, I have an interest in many other forms of development/computer science, such as Cyber Security and UI/UX design. My Dissertation topic was in creating a
Facial Recognition application in Python, as well as research into the technical and ethical aspects of such technology.

My portfolio can be found at https://vexnet.xyz.
